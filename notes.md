We will be using Poetry to manage our dependencies. 

Activity Monitoring:

    Use libraries like psutil or os to track which applications are running and for how long.
    For web browsers, you could use browser extensions (like a Chrome or Firefox extension) to monitor time spent on social media or entertainment websites.

Time Tracking:

    Keep track of the time users spend on various apps or websites.
    Set customizable thresholds for when users are allowed to spend time on different activities (e.g., no more than 1 hour of social media per day).

Alerts:

    When the time limit is reached, pop up a notification or send an alert to remind the user that theyâ€™re over their limit.
    Use libraries like plyer for desktop notifications.

Data Visualization:

    Use matplotlib or seaborn to show users their usage patterns in graphs or charts, giving them a better understanding of how they spend their time.

Customizable Rules:

    Allow users to set specific goals (e.g., focus time, social media break limits) and provide reminders or alerts to keep them on track.

. JavaScript/Node.js (Cross-Platform)

    Electron.js: You can build cross-platform desktop apps using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Electron would allow you to create an app that tracks browser activity or monitors screen time.
    Browser Extensions: You can create a Chrome or Firefox extension using JavaScript to monitor specific website usage (e.g., time spent on social media sites).
